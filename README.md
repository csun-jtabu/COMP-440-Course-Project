# COMP-440-Course-Project

For all parts of this project, your system must be desktop or web-based application. You can use
ANY development tools, however, some simple GUI interfaces are required for each functionality.
All functionalities must be performed via the interface of your system; direct SQL statement
execution via any tools (like MySQL Workbench) is not allowed. 

PART 1 INSTRUCTIONS:

Part 1 – Deadline: Monday, 10/09 by midnight
Use Java/C#/PHP/Python/C++ and SQL, implement the following functionality:
1. (5 pts) Create a database schema and implement a user registration and login interface so
that only a registered user can login into the system. The schema of the user table should be:
user(username, password, firstName, lastName, email)
username is the primary key, and email should be unique. You have to prevent the SQL
injection attack. There is an attached pdf file about SQL injection attacks.
2. (5 pts) Sign up for a new user with information such as: username, password, password
confirmed, first name, last name, email. Duplicate username, and email should be detected
and fail the signup. Unmatching passwords should be detected, as well.

Hint:
1) This is a team project. You are allowed to find and reused codes; however, make sure to
refer to the original source.
2) ONE submission per team is sufficient and all the team members will get the same grade.

How to submit:
1. The source code package. All files (source codes, class files, bat, and txt) should be
contained in a war or zip file called comp440_x_part1.zip for a team whose team number is
x submit via Canvas. (A team number will be assigned to your team by the deadline.)
2. A YouTube video. Use a recorder: https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder.
And upload your video to www.youtube.com. I only need you to record your screen and
your voice for the project demo, not your face. You can add the YouTube URL to a readme
file inside your project directory or add it to the Canvas comment within your submission.
You can create slides for your presentation if that is helpful, Or you can use YouTube for
recording your video:

3. We may ask you to demo your project online via Zoom. It is only a demo between all your
team members and us (instructor and/or grader).

The project is to be done by at least two and a maximum of three students, but each student’s
contribution needs to be clearly stated in readme.txt. Start your project early, and ask questions if
you have doubts. Do not wait until the last minute.
